This is a simple project which uses the flask framework and MySQL for the database. The data was gathered from Austin B Cycle Data (2014). The program will also include basic data structures like queues and potentially some sorting algorithms.  
The basic functionalities for now will be to have the user be able to change date inputs in a web browser and then return plots after some dat amanipulation occurs.
A potential function for the future would be to display a map of the kiosk and then a path showing the start and finishing locations.
